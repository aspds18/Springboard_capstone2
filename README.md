# Predicting Tanzania's water pumps maintenance
This project is an example of applying survival analyses concepts for maintenance. The purpose is to build a model to predict the survival probability and hazard function of a water pump, providing a tool to evaluate predictive maintenance and thus creating both an economic and social benefit. 
## Dataset
So far the dataset has been used for classification problems and competitions.

## Description
Data wrangling and visualization techniques are used to prepare the dataset for the model and to gain insight on the available data.
Three algortihms are considered for a model, i.e. Cox regression, SVM and Random Forest applied to survival analyses.
The code is written in Python and uses some common packages plus the Scikit-survival library.
